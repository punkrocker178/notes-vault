### **1. C# Fundamentals**
Focus on core language features and OOP principles, which are commonly tested in interviews.
#### **Key Topics to Master:**

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
  - Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
  - Example: Explain the difference between **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.

- **Generics and Collections:**
  - `List<T>`, `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`, `IEnumerable<T>`, and `IEnumerator<T>`.
  - Example: When would you use `HashSet<T>` instead of `List<T>`?

  - `Where`, `Select`, `OrderBy`, `GroupBy`, and `Join`.
  - Example: Write a LINQ query to filter a list of users by age.

- **Async/Await and Multithreading:**
  - `async`/`await`, `Task`, `Task<T>`, and `ValueTask`.
  - Example: Explain the difference between **asynchronous** and **synchronous** methods.

- **Exception Handling:**
  - `try/catch/finally`, `throw`, and custom exceptions.
- **Delegates, Events, and Lambdas:**
  - `Func<T>`, `Action<T>`, and event-driven programming.
  - Example: How do you implement an event in C#?

#### **Common Interview Questions:**
- What is the difference between **`string`** and **`StringBuilder`**?
- Explain **boxing** and **unboxing** in C#.
- What is the purpose of **`readonly`** in C#?
- How do you implement **operator overloading**?

### **2. ASP.NET Core**
ASP.NET Core is the primary framework for building backend services in .NET. Focus on key concepts and best practices.

#### **Key Topics to Master:**

- **MVC Architecture:**
  - Controllers, actions, views, and Razor syntax.
  - Example: How does ASP.NET Core handle routing?

- **Dependency Injection (DI):**
  - Services registration (`AddTransient`, `AddScoped`, `AddSingleton`).
  - Example: When would you use `AddSingleton` vs. `AddTransient`?

- **Middleware and Filters:**
  - `Use()`, `Map()`, and `UseRouting()` in the pipeline.
  - Filters: `ActionFilter`, `ResultFilter`, `ExceptionFilter`.

- **Routing and Attribute Routing:**
  - `[Route]`, `[HttpGet]`, `[HttpPost]`, and route constraints.

- **Authentication and Authorization:**
  - JWT, OAuth2, and `AddAuthentication()`/`AddAuthorization()`.

- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Caching (`IMemoryCache`, `IDistributedCache`).
  - Minification and bundling of static files.

#### **Common Interview Questions:**
- What is the difference between **ASP.NET Core** and **classic ASP.NET**?
- How does **dependency injection** work in ASP.NET Core?
- Explain the **middleware pipeline** in ASP.NET Core.
- How do you handle **cross-origin requests (CORS)** in ASP.NET Core?

---

### **3. Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**
EF Core is the ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for .NET. Be prepared to discuss its features and best practices.

#### **Key Topics to Master:**

- **Entity Classes and DbContext:**
  - Mapping entities to database tables.
  - Example: How do you configure a one-to-many relationship using Fluent API?

- **LINQ to Entities:**
  - Querying the database using LINQ.
  - Example: What is the difference between **`ToList()`** and **`ToListAsync()`**?

- **Migrations:**
  - `Add-Migration`, `Update-Database`, and `Enable-Migrations`.

- **Eager Loading, Lazy Loading, and Explicit Loading:**
  - `Include()`, `Load()`, and `AsNoTracking()`.

- **Performance Tips:**
  - Avoiding N+1 queries with `Include()` and `Select()`.

#### **Common Interview Questions:**

- What is the difference between **Entity Framework** and **Entity Framework Core**?
- How do you handle **many-to-many relationships** in EF Core?
- What is **change tracking** in EF Core?
- What is the purpose of **`SaveChanges()`** and **`SaveChangesAsync()`**?

---

### **4. Advanced C# and .NET Concepts**

Be ready to discuss advanced topics and modern practices.

#### **Key Topics:**

- **async/await and Task-based Asynchronous Programming:**
  - Avoid blocking threads with `ConfigureAwait(false)`.
  - Example: How do you handle exceptions in `async` methods?

- **Memory Management and Garbage Collection:**
  - Generations (Gen 0, Gen 1, Gen 2), `IDisposable`, and `using` statements.

- **LINQ to Objects vs. LINQ to Entities:**
  - Differences in query execution and performance.

- **Design Patterns:**
  - Repository, Unit of Work, and Dependency Injection.

- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Profiling with **Application Insights**, **MiniProfiler**, or **Visual Studio Diagnostics**.

- **.NET 6/7 Features (if applicable):**
  - Minimal APIs, **Blazor**, **gRPC**, and **ASP.NET Core Hosting Models**.

#### **Common Interview Questions:**

- What is **`ConfigureAwait(false)`** and when should it be used?
- How does **garbage collection** work in .NET?
- What is the difference between **`IEnumerable<T>`** and **`IQueryable<T>`**?
- How do you implement a **custom middleware** in ASP.NET Core?

### **5. System Design and Architecture**

Full-stack engineers often need to design scalable and maintainable systems. Be prepared to discuss:

#### **Key Topics:**

- **RESTful API Design:**
  - HTTP methods, status codes, and resource naming.

- **API Versioning:**
  - Query string (e.g., `/api/v1/users`) vs. URL path (e.g., `/api/users/v1`).

- **Error Handling and Logging:**
  - Global exception filters, Serilog, or NLog.

- **Caching Strategies:**
  - In-memory caching, Redis, and CDN.

- **Database Design:**
  - Normalization, indexing, and query optimization.

- **Scalability and Microservices:**
  - Horizontal scaling, load balancing, and API gateways.

#### **Common Interview Questions:**

- How would you design a **RESTful API** for a social media platform?
- What are the **trade-offs** between **monolithic** and **microservices** architecture?
- How do you handle **high traffic** in an ASP.NET Core application?

- **Whiteboard or Code on a Shared Screen:**
  - Explain your thought process step-by-step.

- **Ask Clarifying Questions:**
  - If the problem is ambiguous, ask for examples or constraints.
