I'm currently working as a sofware engineer for OneAdvanced company (which is a SaaS provider in different areas like education, health, legal ). I have 5 years of experience in FE development (specificly using Angular framework).

Notable github repo:

  - Storing knowlegde for future reference 
  - Share knowledge
  - Able to structurize knowledge

  - To enhance problem sovling skills by implement reddit client from scratch (plan, design, build, deploy)

Working habits:
- Work carefully and thoughtfully
  - Code meets standard, avoid code duplications
- Review PR carefully. Follow coding convention closely. Though review strictly but still open for new ideas and improvements.
